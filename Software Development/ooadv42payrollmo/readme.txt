OOAD v4.2 Payroll Solution Readme File:

There are several Payroll System models.  They are "incremental".  There is one model
per OOAD/UML v4.2 exercise.  Each model is complete up to and including the exercise 
solution for which it is named.  For example, the 08archdesign.mdl is the Payroll System 
solution up to and including the Architectural Design module solution.  
  
In this way, the model files can be used as a starting point for the course exercises if 
the OOAD and Rose courses are being taught together.

The last model, 13cclassdesign(generalization).mdl, contains everything.  It is the complete
model for the Payroll System.

The following pathmap variable must be set in order to be able to read the 
Payroll System models:
$PAYROLL=<directory where you unzip the model to>

The *.doc files must be placed in a Requirements subdirectory relative to 
the model for the links to the documents to resolve properly.
